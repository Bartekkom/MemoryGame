Hi my name is Bart≈Çomiej and I was familiar with computer since I was a child. I am coding because that is really what is interesting for right now in life.
I want to work in that field because I am creative person with logical thinking. It feels great to be able to code something that actually works and can make 
someone happy. Like for example that MemoryGame I am presenting to you :). 

I know the game Is not perfect, that the code is not really clean but please look up into it, I will take any advice for the future.
I also hope that you will find my code good enough to guide me in coding at your Motorola Academy!
